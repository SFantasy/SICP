Stucture and Interpretation of Computer Programs

## Introduction

This is my exercise of SICP written in [Racket](http://racket-lang.org).

I use DrRacket to do the exercise.

Follow these [instruction](http://www.neilvandyke.org/racket-sicp/) to complete the installation.

## Note

Recently, I use [GitHub WIKI](https://github.com/SFantasy/SICP/wiki) to make notes about the book.
